i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n t smell too much however i ve experimented with it several times to confirm my findings and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads i m 25 with an oily t zone and very dry facial skin on mornings after using this cream i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin there are better products out there

this camera has a very poor lens at 1x zoom the barrel spherical distortion is enormous try taking a picture of a tiled wall image quality is also so so when a picture is viewed at 100 scaled down on a computer monitor the quality is ok color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance

i have been a fan since valotte and i like the other reviewers here ca n t believe why this cd did n t receive the airplay it deserves there must have been some politics in there with sean s cd coming out on the same day yoko it is one of those cds that you just leave on and you do n t feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you do n t like i love every song especially day after day i should have known i do n t want to know and my fav right now cold i hope that what i have heard is true that he is working on his latest now ca n t wait buy this cd you wo n t regret it

worked fine for standard items did not handle partnership issues completely would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed maybe this is possible but i did not find this function in general an easy straightforward program that gets the job done

i have had this camera since jan 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 000 shots while on trips and at weddings do n t expect much from it and you will be happy as an entry level dslr it does what it s supposed to do in ideal conditions i find it s strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving cons in landscape photography this camera is lacking both due to inadequate megapixels and it s inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well battery dies fast the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode approx 150 shots before the battery dies surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge over 300 but hardly enough to last a day i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike so i always carry a backup film camera my trusty elan 7 the viewfinder is very dim when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d s viewfinder in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus the 420ex flash is supposed to talk to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed however with the 300d this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over under exposed after about five months the shutter button started sticking i would click it and then it would remain depressed the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance so would i recommend this camera if you are a casual point and shoot person it s an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere

the video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out the tools are not explained and there is n t as much to do with it as they imply may be nice for birthday party editing i do n t know i did n t like it it s not worth 100 the other capabilities might be nice but from what i ve dealt with that s not the case

i m a huge fan of the pria line but these are not like the others they are heavier and a little grainy i do n t hate them but will not buy them again the flavor is pretty good though just not what i was expecting i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind thank

i have found another product that i want to recommend it s called alert and is sold by consultants like avon but you can also go the starlight website and order it it s a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters and as a bonus i do n t feel hungry when i m using it they also have a product specifically for weight loss i have tried that as well i did feel a bit jittery at first but it settled after a week or so of taking it i would recommend it also i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings i m now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need energy and hunger control and it s less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it i ve used this for years and have not had any problems
