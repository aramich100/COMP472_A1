# Instructions
  For this assignment, you will use python language/the scikit-learn machine learning framework to experiment with two different machine learning algorithms using sentiment data set [1]. The focus of this assignment lies more on the experimentations and analysis than on the implementation. You are required to use python/scikit-learn as a language and an open-source machine learning library for Python (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), which provides an interface to program with a variety of different algorithms and built-in datasets. There are plenty of online documentation and examples of code online (e.g. [2] and [3])

  You must use the data set provided on Moodle [1] associated with this document. This is a collection of customer reviews from six of the review topics. The data has been formatted so that there is one review per line, and the texts have been split into separate words ("tokens") and lowercased.
