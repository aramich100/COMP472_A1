# Instructions

  For this assignment, we used Python along with the scikit-learn machine learning framework to experiment with two different machine learning algorithms. We used a provided sentiment data set. The focus of this assignment was to gain experience on experimentations and analysis. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ for official documentation.

 # Our Results 
 
As instructed, usin the SciKit Framework, we were able to run 3 different Machine Learning Algorithms and obtained very promising results.
 
Naive Bayes Accuracy: 80.65463701216954
Confusion Matrix: [ [1006  224][ 237  916]]
 
Decision Tree Accuracy: 72.2198908938313
Confusion Matrix: [ [870 360] [302 851]]

Better Decision Tree Accuracy: 73.46454049517415
Confusion Matrix: [ [868 362] [318 835]]


We can see that the Naive Bayes algorithm held the highest accuracy while compared to the Decision Tree. This is due to the fact that the Decision Tree is a discriminative model, whereas the Niave Bayes is a generative model. Given out data set, the Naive Bayes is best suited for the hisghest accuracy.
